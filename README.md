# Task Requirements

- Design must be responsive;
- App should work on modern browsers;
- Encouraged to use pre-processors for CSS, but that's optional;
- Email & password validation (not empty, valid email format);
- Make a _fake_ api call to login the user (only valid credentials of email: `frontend@isawesome.com`, password: `cool`);
- Store credentials to `localStorage`, so you wouldn't need to re-login later;
- Throw a greeting message if login was successful or user had credentials in `localStorage`;
